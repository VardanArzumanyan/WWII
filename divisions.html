                    alone had more than 67,000 soldiers. Five of them, the 89th, 409th, 408th, 390th, and 76th

                    western borders against a possible incursion by neighboring Turkey. The 89th Tamanyan Division,
                    composed of ethnic Armenians, distinguished itself during the war. Led by Major General Nver
                    Safaryan, it fought in the Battle of Berlin and entered Berlin. Many Armenian soldiers also served
                    in two other multi-ethnic divisions. They came not only from Soviet Armenia, but also from the other
                    Soviet republics and other countries with considerable Armenian minorities</span>

                    Red Banner named after K. E. Voroshilov) was formed in May of 1922 in Yerevan. Marshals Ivan
                    Baghramyan and Hamazasp Babajanyan served in this division. At the beginning of the War, the
                    Division carried out special operations on the territory of Iran, then participated in fights from
                    Stalingrad to the Baltic states and Belarus, liberating about a thousand settlements.

                    Order of the Red Star) was formed in Yerevan in December 1941. The division began its military path
                    from the foothills of the Caucasus and participated in the liberation of Sevastopol, Balaklava,
                    Kerch. For the heroism demonstrated on Taman Peninsula, the division was given the honorary name
                    “Tamanyan”. <br>
                    Over the course of the war, the Tamanyans liberated more than 900 settlements. Under the command of
                    Major General Nver Safaryan, the 89th Division was among the first ones to cross the border of the
                    USSR, passing through the entire territory of Poland and entering the capital of the Third Reich in
                    the spring of 1945. The division defeated the German garrison in Berlin, and was awarded the Order
                    of Kutuzov Second Class for its accomplishments. In Balaklava, where the mass grave of the 89th
                    Division soldiers is located, the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic erected a memorial monument
                    dedicated to Tamanyans.

                    Division battled at Novorossiysk and Tuapse. In October 1942, despite being completely surrounded,
                    the Division managed to withstand numerous attacks by enemy forces and break through the
                    encirclement, and declared victory on the Elbe.

                    Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky, second Class), was formed in August, 1941. Up until December 1942, it
                    defended the state border from a possible invasion from Turkey. Starting 1943, it participated in
                    battles in the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, Stavropol and Krasnodar, as well
                    as in the battles for the liberation of Hungary. The division is most prominently known, however,
                    for the courage it demonstrated in battles for the liberation of Bratislava. At the end of the war,
                    the members of Division paraded victoriously into Vienna.

                    the Soviet-Turkish state border.

                    Along with the national military troops, eight divisions were established or expanded in Armenia. In
                    addition, during the years of World War II, over 85 thousand recruits were trained in Armenia. Since
                    the territory of Armenia was equated with the frontline zone and a significant part of the state
                    border was passing through its territory, special attention was paid to staff training against any
                    potential invasion attempts by the enemy.

                    Armenian soldiers participated in all major battles and military operations of the Great Patriotic
                    War.
